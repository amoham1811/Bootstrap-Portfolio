# MyPortfolio

The portfolio is divided into seven sections as follows:

1. **Home** - Title page with navigation
2. **About** - Snapshot of developers background and contact details.
3. **Skills** - Proficiency is represented as progress bars in 6 areas. 
4. **Resume** - More detailed account of education and career.
5. **Portfolio** - links to recent project completed.
6. **Contact** - Provides some contact details.
7. **Footer** - Provides some basic copyright or credits information.
